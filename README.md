# @eol/cartograph

The current goals of this project are as follows:

- [ ] create a git history for the MapDB
- [ ] ability to import directly from the `;repository`
- [ ] untangle `StringProc` from the node (Room) definitions
- [ ] build a CI/CD pipeline for the MapDB
- [ ] provide tools for working directly with the mapDB
- [ ] create a `;go2` utility that uses the tarball from this repository
- [ ] some sort of bot that pulls and merges changes from the MapDB (this is difficult)
